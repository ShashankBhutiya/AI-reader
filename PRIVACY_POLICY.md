# Privacy Policy for AI Reader

**Developer/Publisher Name:** ShashankBhutiya
**Contact Email:** support_shashankb_pub@gmail.com
**Last Updated:** 27th September 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how AI Reader (the "App"), developed by ShashankBhutiya ("I," "me," or "my"), collects, uses, processes, and shares data when you use the App.

## 1. Data Accessed and Processed

The AI Reader App is a utility that requires access to system data to perform its core function: summarizing selected text using an external Artificial Intelligence (AI) service.

**A. User Content (Highly Sensitive)**
- **Data Accessed:** The entire content of the text you select and copy (via the system clipboard).
- **How it is Used:** This text is instantly and solely used as the prompt sent to the Gemini API for summarization.
- **Storage by Developer:** None. The App does not store this text content locally or on any server after the request is made.

**B. API Authentication**
- **Data Accessed:** Your Gemini API Key (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`).
- **How it is Used:** Used only for authenticating your requests with Google's Gemini API service.
- **Storage by Developer:** This key is read from a local environment variable on your device. The App is dependent on the User having configured this key externally.

**C. Input Monitoring Data**
- **Data Accessed:** Mouse Click Coordinates (x, y) and Keyboard Hotkey State (Ctrl key).
- **How it is Used:** Used only to detect the activation gesture (Ctrl + Right-Click) to trigger the service and position the pop-up.
- **Storage by Developer:** None. This data is used transiently and never stored or sent anywhere.

## 2. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR Requirement)

I process your data only when necessary to provide the service you have requested. The legal basis for processing is:
- **Contractual Necessity:** Processing the copied text and using the API Key is necessary to fulfill the core function of the App (providing the summary).

## 3. Third-Party Data Processing

**A. Google Gemini API (The Generative AI Service)**

Your selected text is transmitted to Google's cloud servers for processing. The handling of this text is governed by Google's policies, not by the developer (ShashankBhutiya).
- **Data Shared:** The entire copied text and your API key.
- **Purpose:** To generate the summary.
- **Crucial Disclosures Regarding Data Use by Google (for Unpaid API Usage):**
    - **Model Training:** By using the free tier of the Gemini API, you acknowledge that the content of your text and the model's response may be used by Google to improve and develop its machine learning technologies and products. You should avoid using the App to summarize highly sensitive or confidential information.
    - **Abuse Monitoring:** Google logs your prompts and responses for a limited period for the sole purpose of detecting misuse and ensuring compliance with their API policies. This data is disconnected from your API key before human review.

**B. Microsoft Store and Windows Platform**

If distributed via the Microsoft Store, Microsoft may collect anonymous usage and crash data related to the App's performance on your device.
- **Data Shared:** Device identifiers, operating system version, app usage statistics, and non-personal crash dumps.
- **Purpose:** To manage the App listing, process licenses, and provide the developer with aggregated (non-personal) performance reports.
- **Governing Policy:** This data is governed by the official Microsoft Privacy Statement.

## 4. Data We Do Not Collect

To be fully transparent, the AI Reader App does not:
- Store User Content on our servers.
- Sell, rent, or trade your personal information or content to any third parties.
- Track general user activity, only the specific hotkey combination.
- Use the content of your text for advertising or targeted marketing.

## 5. Security and Data Retention

- **Security:** I strive to use industry-standard measures to protect the integrity of the App. The App uses end-to-end processing from your clipboard to the AI service, meaning I never inspect or store the content.
- **Data Retention:**
    - **User Content:** None. The App does not retain copied text after the summary is generated.

## 6. Your Data Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the following rights regarding any personal data (such as email support records) I may hold:
- **Right to Access:** You have the right to request copies of the personal data I hold about you.
- **Right to Deletion:** You have the right to request the deletion of any personal data I may hold, such as support emails.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact me directly using the contact details below.

## 7. Children's Privacy

This App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you believe your child has provided any personal information, please contact me immediately so I can take corrective action.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in my practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. I will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date and posting the new policy on the App's listing page.
